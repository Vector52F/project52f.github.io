The $52f Project: An Orthogonal EcosystemBuilt for the QF Network | ink! v6 Smart ContractsThe $52f Project is a decentralised financial ecosystem built on the principles of mathematical immutability and "Orthogonal Architecture." The system is comprised of five distinct satellite pillars, each governed by specific mathematical constants ($\pi$, $e$, $\sqrt{2}$) and the "52" heartbeat.🏛️ The 5-Pillar Architecture1. The Immutable Fortress (Project52F.rs)The central ledger and tax authority.Standard: PSP22 (PolkaVM compatible).Taxation: Dynamic buy/sell taxes routed to satellites via a "Pull" interface.The Throne: A gamified "King of the Hill" mechanism requiring a $1.1557\times$ dethrone multiplier.Security: Hardened with a Circuit Breaker (Pause) and MIN_TRANSACTION_THRESHOLD to prevent dusting attacks.2. The Birthday Paradox (BirthdayParadox.rs)A high-frequency collision game governed by probability.Mechanism: Sparse matrix with 1,000 slots.Logic: $MOD 1000$ hashing of block metadata.Triggers: Fibonacci sequence (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34) and the King Slot (52).Boost: $\sqrt{2}$ payout multiplier during the "Golden Window" (Hours 20-24 GMT).3. The Dampener Vault (DampenerVault.rs)Automated market stability and liquidity floor management.Target: Authorised to maintain a 15% Liquidity-to-Market-Cap ratio.Security: 60-minute TWAP Oracle integration to prevent flash-loan manipulation.Anti-MEV: Strictly enforced 5% "Drip-Feed" limit per hour and per-block injection throttling.4. The Victory Lap (Project52Pulse.rs)The ecosystem's long-term deflationary heartbeat.Interval: 52,000,000 blocks (~60.18 days).Mechanism: Triple-guarded burn event triggered only when liquidity is healthy and excess $QF$ exceeds 6.25%.Action: Programmatic market-buy and permanent token burn.5. The Team Vault (Project52Vault.rs)Transparency-first team allocation and vesting.Allocation: Holds $\pi \times e \times \sqrt{2}$ (~12.07%) of the initial supply.Schedule: Exactly 52 tranches released every 5,200,000 blocks.Maths: Hardened "Dust-Clearing" logic ensures the 52nd tranche perfectly zeroes the contract balance.🛠️ Technical ImplementationDevelopment EnvironmentLanguage: Rust (no_std)Framework: ink! v6VM: PolkaVMSpelling: UK English (Maths, Centre, Organisation)Security PrinciplesPull-over-Push: Satellites pull revenue from the Fortress; users pull winnings from Satellites. This eliminates reentrancy and out-of-gas errors.Checks-Effects-Interactions: All state changes occur before external calls/transfers.Zero God Mode: Manual reset and administrative bypass functions have been removed for production-grade immutability.🚀 Deployment OrderDeploy Fortress: Initialize with total supply and project metadata.Deploy Satellites: Deploy Paradox, Dampener, Pulse, and Vault using the Fortress address in their constructors.Link: Call propose_game_address and set_dampener_address on the Fortress to authorize the satellites.
